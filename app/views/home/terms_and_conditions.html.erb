  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>TEKKOVA PTY LTD or Tekkova (hereinafter “we”, “our”, us reserve the right, based on sole discretion, to alter our Services or to alter the Terms at any time. If we alter the Terms, we will post the modification on our website.  By continuing to access or use our Services after we have posted a modification, you are representing that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the altered Terms are not acceptable to you, you should stop using and accessing the Services and close your account within 30 days, in which case the previous effective version of the Terms will apply to you, except you have used the Services during the intervening 30 day period, in which case the new Terms of Service will be applicable to you.</p>
  <h1>Basic Terms</h1>
  <h4>Eligibility</h4>
  <p>Our Services are intended for individuals who are 21 or older. Any use of the Services by anyone under 21 as of the time of current signup is expressly prohibited unless stated otherwise.</p>
  <h4>Agency</h4>
  <p>Tekkova does not appoint you or any other user as its employee, mandatory, legal agent, or form any kind of legal partnership or joint venture. For taxation purposes you may request a payment summary from Tekkova and are accountable for doing your own taxations. You are not authorized to make any commitments on behalf of Tekkova and Tekkova will not make commitments on your behalf, except as contemplated by Services or expressly stated in this Agreement. By continuing forward with the listing process Car hosts agree that they are the sole owner of the vehicle or have the legal right to offer the vehicle for rental purposes. Hosts acknowledge that Tekkova is a marketplace that enables and facilitates peer to peer car share in terms of rental purposes and Tekkova does not take personal responsibility for negligence that may occur as a result of travellers not fulfilling their duties as stated in this agreement such as returning the car not as expected by the traveller. Certain fees and charges may apply in certain circumstances that will be paid out to car hosts in case of breech of this agreement by the traveller. Car hosts agree to appoint Tekkova to provide insurance, market the vehicle and oversee the rental process between a car host and traveller. This agreement is enforced once a Car owner has successfully listed their vehicles on the Tekkova platform.</p>
  <h4>Registration</h4>
  <p>To access or use certain features of the Services you will be required to sign up for an account with us (henceforth a “Tekkova Account”). Registration basically involves providing us your email address and creating a password or registering using a third-party social networking site account (“SNS”) such as Facebook and Google.</p>
  <h4>Verification</h4>
  <p>When you sign up to either list or book a vehicle, you will give us with certain information about yourself to help us to verify your identity so as to become an “Approved Driver or Car Host.” You promise to provide complete and correct information to us about yourself and your vehicle(s), if any. Where permitted, we have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake screenings, checks, and processes designed to help verify or check the identities and/or backgrounds of users and vehicles, including driving history and driver’s licence validity, but we do not guarantee any vehicle, user, or his or her background, or commit to undertake any specific screening process. Tekkova may in its sole discretion use third-party services to verify the information you give to us and to acquire additional related information and corrections where applicable and you hereby authorize Tekkova to request, receive, use, and store such information. Based on sole discretion, Tekkova may accept or reject your application to become an Approved Driver or Host.</p>
  <h4>Consumer Report Authorisation</h4>
  <p>When you apply to become an Approved Driver/traveller or Host, you are granting Tekkova written instructions and authorization in line with applicable consumer reporting laws, or any similar laws, to obtain your personal and/or business auto insurance score, credit report and/or administer a background check, even a criminal background check where permissible under applicable law. Also, you are authorizing Tekkova to acquire your personal and/or business auto insurance score, credit report or conduct a background check at any time Tekkova reasonably believes there may be an increased level of risk regarding your Tekkova Account.</p>
  <h4>Information Updates</h4>
  <p>You agree to update the information you have provided to Tekkova in the event of any modifications to your driving record, contact information, or background. Particularly as regards to your contact information, Tekkova may send notices to you at the most recent email, telephone, or billing address provided by you, and those notices will be deemed valid even if you no longer have access to or use the email account, telephone number, or receive mail at that address except you provide updated contact information to us.
  Also, you are entirely responsible for any activity that happens via your account, so ensure you keep your password and account information secure. You guarantee that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take complete responsibility for any activities or actions under your Tekkova Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will promptly notify Tekkova of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Tekkova Account. We are not responsible for your failure or inability to comply with this clause, or for any delay in shutting down or protecting your account after you have reported unauthorized access to us.</p>
  <h4>Fees for travellers</h4>
  <p>Tekkova expects travellers to handover and drop off the vehicle in the same condition as it was picked up. Our fee policies are in place to have a fair marketplace to look after both the host and traveller. Travellers are responsible for paying all fees if they apply either upon, during or after the return of the vehicle. These fees may apply only if applicable but not limited to traffic infringements, Parking fines, tolls, fuel, late return, late cancellation within 1-12 hours from scheduled pick up date and time unless it occurs due to unforeseen circumstances such as flight delays, exterior cleaning, interior general cleaning, interior smoke odour removal, pet hair removal, excess mileage and an extension request within 1-12 hours before scheduled return of the vehicle if the vehicle has been booked by another traveller on the scheduled return date. For all the above mentioned points photographic evidence is necessary to be provided to Tekkova at the time of claim by the car host however claims such as smoke odour removal fees will be paid to the assigned cleaning company and not the host. Tekkova chooses not to charge any amount of bond as security deposit for certain vehicles however car hirers are liable for any charges that may occur during the trip or use of the vehicle. Travellers will be notified before any applicable charges that may be deducted from their nominated credit card, credit card fees of between 1 to 3% may apply for any transactioned performed on Tekkova including all bookings. If Tekkova is unsuccessful in obtaining any overdue amount, Tekkova may choose to involve debt collectors at the discretion of Tekkova. Booking fees, subjected to credit card fees, must be paid right away when you send request to book a car and once it is accepted by the car Host. You can view all our fees and charges on our website. Please note that admin charges may apply for certain fees. You authorize Tekkova to charge any payment methods or stored payment credentials associated with your account for all amounts due, including but not limited to, security deposits, processing fees, fees, fines/penalties, deductibles, and damages, and you furthermore represent and warrant that you or Tekkova have the right to make this authorization. You will be responsible for all of the costs relating to any citations and fines (e.g. tolls, parking tickets, parking fees, towing fees on non-mechanical tows) incurred during the reservation period. If a car is towed away by law enforcement due to the traveller or their passengers using the vehicle in an illegal/ hoon manner on public roads, Tekkova may choose to cancel your account and all legal costs, damages, towing, parking fees will apply to the driver or the Tekkova account holder responsible. Towing fees may also apply in other circumstances such as the traveller losing the keys and a $400 key replacement fee will apply.</p>

Hosts by listing their vehicles on Tekkova agree that if deemed necessary Tekkova from time to time may choose to offer discounts in order to boost booking rates and that may reduce host’s potential earnings however hosts will be notified if their booking has come through our discounted promotions.  </p>

  <h4>Tekkova liability, Vehicle and Personal Protection</h4>
  <p>During the applicable reservation period, Tekkova, or third parties acting for the mutual benefit of Tekkova and our users, will provide certain comprehensive and collision protection for the vehicle however Tekkova or our partners do not accept any liability for bodily injury/death or property damage that may be caused by a traveller whilst having a Tekkova listed car in their possession however in case of bodily harm caused by the use of the vehicle travellers are covered by the statutory schemes for transport accident compensation across Australia in respect to each state and territory. If an accident or damages occurs either to the vehicle or third party property whilst the traveller is under the influence of drugs or alcohol the traveller is responsible for all the costs and legal fees associated with the incident and they will not be protected to any extent by Tekkova’s vehicle insurance or protection plan. Tekkova protection plan does not cover any losses of personal goods or possessions that may occur as a result of theft during the hire period or goods that have been either left behind or forgotten in the car. Tekkova protection plan also does not cover damages to the vehicle as a result of flooding of water to the engine where a traveller has crossed a ditch filled with water or damages to underneath the car caused by speed humps or pot holes. You understand and agree that an excess fee or damage liability fee of up to $500 may apply in the event of an accident and the liability fee will be refunded back to you if you are not deemed to be at fault. Tekkova does not claim any responsibility for the condition of the vehicle either mechanical or cosmetic wise as a result of this Tekkova may not be responsible for any vehicle that may not meet the expectation of our travellers. It is the responsibility of our hosts to ensure that their vehicle meets the listing criteria of Tekkova. The liability insurance and the comprehensive and collision protection shall be excess and contingent over any other valid and collectible insurance that may be available to the guest. In some cases hosts may provide their own insurance and as a result of that they may increase their earning potentials. Tekkova is currently working with our insurance partners to have our hosts and their vehicles protected however in order to accomplish this Tekkova first of all needs a list of vehicle owners that need insurance protection for their vehicles. Tekkova will not commence or allow for bookings to take place unless we have provided our car hosts with insurance on their vehicles beforehand.</p>
  <h4>Termination</h4>
  <p>You may discontinue your use of the Services at any time and Tekkova may terminate your access to the Services and remove any listings for any reason or no reason to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law. Termination of access to the Services will not release either party from any obligations incurred prior to the termination and Tekkova may keep and continue to use any information, including but not limited to photography, previously provided by you. Termination of this Agreement will not have any effect on the disclaimers, waiver or liability limitations, or legal disputes provisions under this Agreement and/or any fees due, and all of those terms will survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>
  <h4>No Transfer or Assignment</h4>
  <p>Unless as otherwise provided herein, guests and hosts warrant that nothing in these Terms establishes an actual or purported transfer or assignment of any right or interest in a vehicle shared through the Tekkova Services.</p>
  <h4>Disclaimers</h4>
  <p>Tekkova provides services that enable vehicle sharing between hosts and guests. Except as otherwise provided in these terms, Tekkova does not itself provide insurance services and is not responsible for any of the acts or omissions of any of the users of its services, the vehicle manufacturer, or any third party provider of services (e.g. in-vehicle Gps or other systems). The services are provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied. to the extent permitted by applicable law, without limiting the foregoing, Tekkova explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment or non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.

Tekkova reserves the right to enable bookings at its own discretion upon having enough cars listed to have the platform running.</p>
  <h4>Additional Limitation of Liability and Waiver</h4>
  <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any and all rights you have to sue or make claims against Tekkova and its respective subsidiaries, directors, officers, agents, or employees (the “Tekkova  parties”) and any Tekkova user for any damages or losses arising out of or in line with your use of the services including, with no limitation to, a vehicle not being available when it was ought to be, any malfunction of or deficiency in a vehicle, any violation of warranty or other obligation by any manufacturer or other third party, any personal injury or property damage suffered by you or any of your passengers and, in the case of the Tekkova parties, any actions or inaction of the host. neither Tekkova nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or offering services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, such as lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, from the use of or inability to use the services, or from your listing or booking of any vehicle through the services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability, or any other legal theory. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable hosts or guests pursuant to these Terms, including an approved payment request or claim under an insurance package or applicable insurance policy, in no event will Tekkova or its insurer’s aggregate liability resulting from or in line with this Agreement or your use of the Services, exceed the greater of the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings through the services as a guest. Tekkova is not liable for any claims that are out of control of Tekkova or our insurance partners such as cancellations by our hosts. The limitations of damages set forth above are essential elements of the basis of the bargain between Tekkova and you. Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not be applicable to you. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ABOVE MENTIONED POINTS DO NOT INCLUDE INCIDENTS OR DAMAGES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A TRAVELLER TO THE VEHICLE OF THE HOST DURING A TRIP.
    To the extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any and all rights you have to sue or make claims against any Tekkova user for any damages or losses arising out of or in line with your use of the services unless (1) you are a host who has declined an insurance package via Tekkova and are making a claim against a guest who booked a vehicle for which you opted to offer your own commercial/rental insurance or protection to the guest; or (2) you are a guest who booked a vehicle from a host who opted to decline an insurance package through Tekkova and opted to offer insurance or protection directly to you and you are making a claim against that company/host.
  </p>
  <h4>Indemnification</h4>
  <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Tekkova and its subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services or your violation of these Terms; your user content; your interaction with any user, booking of a vehicle, or creation of a listing for a vehicle; or the use, condition, or trip, including but not limited to any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential, or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of a booking, sharing, or use of a vehicle.</p>
  <h4>Liquidated damages/Contract penalty</h4>
  <p>You accept that the actual damages likely to result from engaging in gray market transactions (i.e., using Tekkova to find a guest or vehicle, and then completing a reservation or related transaction partially or wholly independent of Tekkova, in order to circumvent the obligation to pay any Tekkova Fees) are difficult to estimate and would be difficult for Tekkova to prove. You will pay Tekkova AUS$5,500 in Liquidated Damages to compensate Tekkova for any such conduct. This amount is not intended as a punishment for any such breach.
    Tekkova does not own a fleet of vehicles. Tekkova is in the business of providing an online platform where vehicle owners and those in need of a vehicle can meet and share vehicles amongst themselves in according with these Terms.
  </p>
  <h4>Rounding off</h4>
  <p>Tekkova may, in its sole discretion, round up or down amounts that are payable from or to Owners or Travelers to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, pound, or other supported currency) where permissible under applicable law.</p>
  <h4>General</h4>

Except for appointing a custodian to manage your vehicles on your behalf, you may not assign your legal obligations or transfer any of your rights, in part or in whole, to any third party without advance written permission of the Tekkova.

    Headings used herein are for the sake of reference only and do not limit the scope or extent of each Section of the Terms.
    Unless as otherwise stated in this Agreement, if any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
